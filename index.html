      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

      <p>I absolutely love Zootopia for it's story, animation, lovable characters, heart and lessons about how our world is, racism and developing ourselves as people in making our world a better place for everyone. The movie tells an emotional tale about an optimistic friendly hardworking rabbit Judy Hopps who wants to prove herself by making society a peaceful better place. In doing so she became Zootopia’s first rabbit Officer with a valedictorian degree. Everyone believed she wasn’t capable of achieving this dream so she took on a case and partnered up with a wisecracking laidback fox Nick Wilde. He may appear manipulative, cold and rude at first but he is shown to have a sweet caring side later but changed as he had grown up. In order to solve this case the two unlikely pair must learn to get along, work together and trust each other in order to successfully keep their city safe. This film has some emotional relatable moments that will teach you to follow your dreams and learn from your mistakes for a better tomorrow. I didn’t understand it when it first came out back in 2016 but now I truly see what the movie is telling us and why it is important for us to get the message especially during this hard time. A definite recommended. I look forward for another adventure in the world of Zootopia very soon</p>

      <p>I've always loved the character from Shrek 2 because of his big eyes which I find adorable. I love this movie because it's funny and I can't wait for the sequel which I'm going to go see later this year. Humpty Dumpty and kitty soft paws are my favorite characters. My first favorite character from the movie is definitely Kitty Soft Paws because of how pretty she is. I have a picture of her as my home screen on this device. My second favorite character is Humpty Dumpty because I've heard of the fairy tale a lot about how he had a great fall from sitting on a wall and it's also because he's hilarious.</p>

      <p>This is easily one of the best sequels I've ever seen for a movie. I love the tension with Tim and Ted when they weren’t spending enough time together as kids, and Tim realizing how fast Tabitha is growing up and they won’t be able to have these moments forever. The villain is also much better than in the original Boss Baby. Jeff Goldblum’s Armstrong is probably one of Dreamworks’ most enjoyable villains, and I especially love it at the end that be reunites with his family after realizing what he is taking away by brainwashing the adults. And Together We Stand, warms my heart to death, this seems like something that would be pulled off by Disney, but no, Dreamworks pulled off one of the most heartwarming sequences ever in any animated film. Give this all the rotten tomatoes, because this is a perfect sequel to the original Boss Baby in pretty much every way. And I hope that Together We Stand wins an Oscar for best original song.</p>
